<h1 align="center">Pass In - DevOps</h1>

## About this Project

pass.in is an application for **managing participants in in-person events**.

The tool allows the organizer to register an event and open a public registration page. Registered participants can issue a credential for check-in on the day of the event.
The system will scan the participant's credentials to allow entry to the event.

## Functionalities

### Functional requirements

- [x] The organizer must be able to register a new event;
- [x] The organizer must be able to view event data;
- [x] The organizer must be able to view the list of participants;
- [x] The participant must be able to register for an event;
- [x] The participant must be able to view their registration badge;
- [x] The participant must be able to check-in at the event;

### Business rules

- [x] The participant can only register for an event once;
- [x] Participants can only register for events with available places;
- [x] The participant can only check-in to an event once;

### Non-functional requirements

- [x] Check-in at the event will be carried out using a QRCode;

## Database

In this application we will use a relational database (SQL). For the development environment, we will continue with SQLite due to the ease of the environment.

During the deployment process, the database will be changed to Postgresql.
